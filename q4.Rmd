In this problem, we are going to analysis some data (Superhero.dat) relating to childrenâ€™s injuries while wearing superhero costumes. Children reporting to the emergency center at hospitals had the severity of their injury (injury) assessed (on a scale from 0, no injury, to 100, death). In addition, a note was taken of which superhero costume they were wearing (hero): Spiderman (1), Superman (2), the Hulk (3) or a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle (4).

(a) Read the data `superhero.dat` by using `read_tsv` from `tidyverse`.


(b) Recode the costume labels and make the variable a "factor".


(c) Run a linear regression model to predict level of injury.


(d)) Draw some boxplots to show the injury severity for each superhero costumes.
