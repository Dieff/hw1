# Question 4

In this problem, we are going to analysis some data (Superhero.dat) relating to childrenâ€™s injuries while wearing superhero costumes. Children reporting to the emergency center at hospitals had the severity of their injury (injury) assessed (on a scale from 0, no injury, to 100, death). In addition, a note was taken of which superhero costume they were wearing (hero): Spiderman (1), Superman (2), the Hulk (3) or a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle (4).

(a) Read the data `superhero.dat` by using `read_tsv` from `tidyverse`.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
superheros <- read_tsv("superhero.dat")
head(superheros)
```


(b) Recode the costume labels and make the variable a "factor".

```{r}
superheros_labelled <- superheros
superheros_labelled$hero <- factor(superheros_labelled$hero, labels = c("Spiderman", "Superman", "Hulk", "TMZ"))
head(superheros_labelled)
```

(c) Run a linear regression model to predict level of injury.

```{r}
model <- lm(injury ~ hero, data = superheros)
summary(model)
```

```{r}
ggplot(superheros, aes(x = hero, y = injury)) + geom_point() + geom_abline(slope = model$coefficients[2], intercept = model$coefficients[1])
```


(d) Draw some boxplots to show the injury severity for each superhero costumes.

Spiderman
```{r}
spider <- superheros_labelled %>% filter(hero == "Spiderman")
boxplot(spider$injury)
```
Superman
```{r}
super <- superheros_labelled %>% filter(hero == "Superman")
boxplot(super$injury)
```

The Hulk
```{r}
hulk <- superheros_labelled %>% filter(hero == "Hulk")
boxplot(hulk$injury)
```

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
```{r}
tmz <- superheros_labelled %>% filter(hero == "TMZ")
boxplot(tmz$injury)
```
