This question involves the use of linear regression on the `Auto` data set from the textbook library `ISLR`. You could do `?Auto` to check the description of the dataset.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ISLR)
head(Auto)
```


(a) Use the `lm()` function to perform a linear regression with `mpg` as the response and `horsepower` as the predictor.

(b) Plot the response and the predictor as well as the regression line. Any comment?

(c) What's the prediction of `mpg` if `horsepower` is 100?


(d) What's the value of `R^2`? 


(e) Try a few different transformations of the predictor. And which is the best one you could find?
